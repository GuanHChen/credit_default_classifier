Binary encoding of SEX variable
Female = 0
Male = 1


Ordinal encoding of EDUCATION
0 = Others, Unknown         280+123+51+14
1 = High School             4917
2 = University              14030
3 = Graduate School         10585



One-hot encoding of MARRIAGE
0 = Not sure what this is   54
1 = Married                 13659
2 = Single                  15964
3 = Other                   323

Single and Married will be one hot encoded
Values of 0 and for Other will be dropped. If someone is neither married or single,
the other category is implicit
